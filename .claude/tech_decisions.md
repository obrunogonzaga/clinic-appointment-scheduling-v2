# Technical Decisions

## Architecture Decisions

### Backend: Python FastAPI
**Decision**: Use Python with FastAPI framework for the backend API
**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: FastAPI is one of the fastest Python frameworks, built on Starlette and Pydantic
- **Developer Experience**: Automatic API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- **Type Safety**: Native Python type hints with runtime validation
- **Async Support**: Built-in async/await support for handling concurrent requests
- **Modern**: Active development, modern Python features (3.8+)
- **Team Familiarity**: Python is widely known, reducing onboarding time

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Django: Too heavyweight for a pure API, includes ORM we don't need with MongoDB
- Flask: Requires more boilerplate, less performant, no built-in validation
- Node.js/Express: Would require TypeScript for type safety, team less familiar

### Database: MongoDB
**Decision**: Use MongoDB as the primary database
**Rationale**:
- **Flexible Schema**: Healthcare data often has varying structures, easy to add new fields without migrations
- **Document Model**: Natural fit for patient records with nested data (contacts, history, preferences)
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling for growing patient databases
- **Performance**: Fast queries on large datasets with proper indexing
- **Geospatial**: Built-in support for location-based queries for route optimization
- **Aggregation Pipeline**: Powerful analytics capabilities for patient statistics and reports
- **Document Structure**: Patient records naturally fit MongoDB's document model with embedded arrays and objects

**Specific Benefits for This Project**:
- Master Patient Registry with embedded contact history
- Advanced search across multiple fields without complex joins
- Smart filtering with compound indexes
- Geographic insights using 2dsphere indexes
- Family group management with document references
- Collection history as embedded documents for fast retrieval

**Alternatives Considered**:
- PostgreSQL: Would require complex joins for nested data, schema migrations more rigid
- MySQL: Similar limitations to PostgreSQL, less suited for document-style data
- DynamoDB: Vendor lock-in, more complex local development

### Frontend: React with Vite
**Decision**: Use React with Vite as the build tool
**Rationale**:
- **Build Speed**: Vite offers instant HMR and fast cold starts
- **Modern Tooling**: ES modules, better tree-shaking, smaller bundles
- **React Ecosystem**: Large community, extensive libraries
- **Developer Experience**: Fast feedback loop, better debugging
- **Production Ready**: Optimized builds with code splitting

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Create React App: Slower builds, less flexible configuration
- Next.js: Overkill for SPA, adds complexity we don't need
- Vue.js: Smaller ecosystem, team more familiar with React

### Styling: Tailwind CSS
**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling
**Rationale**:
- **Rapid Development**: Utility-first approach speeds up development
- **Consistency**: Design system built-in with consistent spacing/colors
- **Performance**: PurgeCSS removes unused styles in production
- **Maintainability**: No CSS naming conflicts or specificity issues
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first responsive design utilities

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Material-UI: Heavy bundle size, harder to customize
- Styled Components: Runtime overhead, harder to optimize
- Plain CSS/SASS: More time-consuming, harder to maintain consistency

### State Management: React Context + React Query
**Decision**: Use React Context for global state and React Query for server state
**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: No additional state management library needed
- **Server State**: React Query handles caching, synchronization, and updates
- **Performance**: React Query reduces unnecessary API calls
- **Developer Experience**: Less boilerplate than Redux
- **Built-in Features**: Optimistic updates, background refetching

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux + RTK: More complex, overkill for our needs
- Zustand: Good option, but Context is sufficient for our use case
- MobX: Steeper learning curve, more magic

### Authentication: JWT
**Decision**: Use JSON Web Tokens for authentication
**Rationale**:
- **Stateless**: No server-side session storage needed
- **Scalable**: Works well with microservices and multiple servers
- **Standard**: Industry standard, well-understood
- **Mobile Ready**: Easy to implement in future mobile apps
- **Secure**: When implemented correctly with refresh tokens

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Session-based: Requires session storage, harder to scale
- OAuth2: Overkill for internal system, adds complexity
- Basic Auth: Not secure enough for healthcare data

### Container Orchestration: Docker Compose
**Decision**: Use Docker Compose for local development and simple deployments
**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and manage
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent environment across development
- **Sufficient**: Meets our current scale requirements
- **Migration Path**: Easy to move to Kubernetes later if needed
- **Cost Effective**: No orchestration overhead for small deployments

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Kubernetes: Overkill for current scale, steep learning curve
- Docker Swarm: Less community support, uncertain future
- No containers: Inconsistent environments, deployment issues

### File Processing: Pandas
**Decision**: Use Pandas for Excel/CSV file processing
**Rationale**:
- **Robust**: Handles various file formats and edge cases
- **Performance**: Efficient for data manipulation
- **Features**: Built-in data cleaning and transformation
- **Integration**: Works well with Python ecosystem
- **Familiar**: Widely used in data processing

**Alternatives Considered**:
- OpenPyXL alone: Less powerful for data manipulation
- Custom implementation: Time-consuming, error-prone
- Apache POI (Python binding): More complex, less Pythonic

### API Communication: REST
**Decision**: Use RESTful API design
**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Well-understood, easy to implement
- **Tooling**: Excellent tooling support (Postman, Swagger)
- **Caching**: HTTP caching works out of the box
- **Standards**: Follows HTTP standards and conventions
- **Frontend Compatible**: Works well with React Query

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GraphQL: Adds complexity, overkill for our data needs
- gRPC: Better for microservices, not web browsers
- WebSockets: Only needed for specific real-time features

### Testing Strategy: Pytest + Jest
**Decision**: Use Pytest for backend and Jest for frontend testing
**Rationale**:
- **Industry Standard**: Both are de facto standards
- **Features**: Rich assertion libraries and mocking
- **Integration**: Work well with CI/CD pipelines
- **Documentation**: Extensive documentation and community
- **Performance**: Fast test execution

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Backend: unittest (too verbose), nose (deprecated)
- Frontend: Mocha (more setup), Vitest (less mature)

### Code Quality: ESLint + Black
**Decision**: Use ESLint for JavaScript and Black for Python formatting
**Rationale**:
- **Consistency**: Enforces consistent code style
- **Automation**: Auto-formatting saves time
- **Standards**: Follow community standards
- **Integration**: Work well with IDEs and CI/CD
- **Zero Config**: Black is opinionated, no debates

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Prettier (JS): Good option, team preferred ESLint
- Pylint: More opinionated, slower than Black
- Manual formatting: Time-consuming, inconsistent

## Future Considerations

### When to Revisit These Decisions

1. **Scaling Beyond 10,000 Daily Active Users**: Consider Kubernetes
2. **Multiple Clinic Locations**: May need microservices architecture
3. **Real-time Features**: Add WebSocket support with Socket.io
4. **Complex Reporting**: Consider adding a data warehouse
5. **Mobile Apps**: May need to add GraphQL for efficient data fetching

### Migration Strategies

Each technical decision includes a migration path if requirements change:
- MongoDB → PostgreSQL: Use ODM abstraction layer
- REST → GraphQL: Can run both in parallel
- Docker Compose → Kubernetes: Helm charts for migration
- React Context → Redux: Gradual migration component by component
