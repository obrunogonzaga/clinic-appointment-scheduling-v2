# Backend Implementation Plan

This document outlines steps to migrate the scheduling system from the current front-end mock implementation to a real back-end service.

## Key Features from Patients Module

Based on lines 6-16 of `PATIENTS_MODULE.md` the Patients module requires:

- **Master Patient Registry**
- **Advanced Search Engine**
- **Smart Filtering System**
- **Quick Statistics Dashboard**
- **Complete Patient Profiles** and related features

These features imply a full database with sophisticated query and analytics capabilities.

## Next Steps from `project-status.md`

The **Next Steps** section identifies the following priorities:

1. Patient database implementation
2. Schedule integration
3. Production deployment

## Proposed Backend Roadmap

1. **Select Stack and Database**
   - Choose a server framework such as **Node.js/Express** or **Python/FastAPI**.
   - Use a relational database like **PostgreSQL** or a document store such as **MongoDB** for patient search and analytics.

2. **Design Data Models**
   - Base the schema on the detailed patient record in `PATIENTS_MODULE.md`. Include personal information, contact details, health plan data, confirmation history, analytics fields and tags.
   - Create models for schedules, cars/drivers and confirmation records to support schedule integration.

3. **Implement API Endpoints**
   - `/patients` &mdash; CRUD operations plus advanced search/filter support
   - `/appointments` or `/schedule` &mdash; manage schedule entries
   - `/upload` &mdash; receive spreadsheet files and process them (migrating the logic from `fileProcessor.js`)
   - `/drivers` or `/cars` &mdash; manage driver/car assignments
   - Authentication endpoints as needed

4. **Move File Processing to the Server**
   - Reuse the existing spreadsheet parsing logic in a server-side service for centralized validation and data import.

5. **Support Operational Features**
   - Add endpoints for confirmation tracking, SMS/WhatsApp communication and analytics as described in the Patients module specification.

6. **Integrate With React Front-End**
   - Replace mock data with API calls using `fetch` or `axios`.
   - Maintain the current component structure while sourcing data from the new endpoints.

7. **Deployment and Testing**
   - Create automated tests for API endpoints.
   - Plan for staging and production deployment once key integrations are complete.

This plan provides a path to evolve the existing prototype into a full system with a real database and server-side features.
